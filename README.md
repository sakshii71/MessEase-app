# MessEase-app
An app to streamline paid mess at hostels.
Mess-Ease is a mobile application developed to simplify and digitalize the food ordering and mess administration system in educational institutions. The system supports three types of users: subscribed students, non-subscribed students, and mess workers. The application provides functionalities for secure login, menu updates, order placement, billing, and checkout.

1. Project Overview

The primary objective of Mess-Ease is to automate the mess management workflow. It allows students to browse the menu, place food orders, and generates a structured summary including billing details. Mess workers can manage the menu and update food items in real time.

This system improves efficiency by eliminating manual entries, reduces waiting time, and ensures transparency in billing and credits.

2. Features
Subscribed Students

Login using name, registration number, email, 4-digit code, and mess block selection.
